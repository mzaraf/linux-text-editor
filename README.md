I then entered insert mode by pressing `i` and typed in the following text: "Hello, this is a Vim hands-on project.
Welcome to darey.io"  

tried few other things like moving around the file using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` keys.

Deleting the text using `x` key. also deleting entire line using `dd` key.

Undoing chnages by pressing `u` key in the insert mode.

I then exited insert mode by pressing `esc` and saved the file by pressing `:wq`

screenshot of the file is attached.
